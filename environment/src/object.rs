//! Objects that can be placed in a world and their components.
//! # Examples
//! The following defines a stationary square terrain:
//! ```
//! use myelin_environment::object::*;
//!
//! let square = ObjectDescription {
//!     shape: Polygon {
//!         vertices: vec![
//!             Vertex { x: -50, y: -50 },
//!             Vertex { x: -50, y: 50 },
//!             Vertex { x: 50, y: 50 },
//!             Vertex { x: 50, y: -50 },
//!         ],
//!     },
//!     position: Position {
//!         rotation: Radians(0.0),
//!         location: Location { x: 100, y: 100 },
//!     },
//!     kind: Kind::Terrain,
//!     mobility: Mobility::Immovable
//! };
//! ```
//! The prefered way of constructing a [`ObjectDescription`] however
//! is by using an [`ObjectBuilder`].
